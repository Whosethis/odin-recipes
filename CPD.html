    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These fried dumplings are from Liana Cafe House in Seattle's International District. They sell traditional Chinese pork dumplings from a tiny takeout shop but with this recipe, you can see how to make them at home!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dipping Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped Chinese chives</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dumplings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese chives</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>50 dumpling wrappers</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare dipping sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, chives, sesame seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare dumplings: Mix pork, garlic, egg, chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle. Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat to form remaining dumplings.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in 1 cup of water; cover and cook until the dumplings are tender and pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat to cook remaining dumplings, adding more oil and water for each batch.</li>
        <li>Serve dumplings with dipping sauce.</li>
